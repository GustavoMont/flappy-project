## About it

This project was basically developed during the study of the modern Web Course. It is basically a replica of Flappy Bird, an old mobile game 📱🐦. The idea of the project is basically just training dom events, about parentship of html elements and somethings about POO, it's not literally POO but it's almost.

## My considerations

I did this project with a video tutorial so, I have some doubts about the code, I can understand its logic 🤯, but I have to get used to coding using constructor functions. It was a good experience and I hope in future I can code something like it. 😁🤓
